Now we have a look at a user-defined datatype, a `struct`:

`go run $G4OHOME/code/structs/main.go`{{execute}}

Next, we learn how to use a `function`:

`go run $G4OHOME/code/functions/main.go`{{execute}}

Go also supports `methods`, essentially a function with a defined receiver:

`go run $G4OHOME/code/methods/main.go`{{execute}}

In Go, errors are first class citizens:

`go run $G4OHOME/code/errors/main.go`{{execute}}

Sometimes it's useful to extract common behavior into an `interface`:

`go run $G4OHOME/code/interfaces/main.go`{{execute}}
