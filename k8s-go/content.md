`cd /root/work/src/github.com/openshift-talks/k8s-go/`{{execute}}

You will learn how to interact with the Kubernetes API, from the basics using `curl` and `kubectl` to [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to writing custom resources and controllers.

Note: this playground supports Go 1.10 and Kubernetes 1.10 as well as a number of tools (incl. `jq`, `nano`, and `emacs`) that you will be using throughout.
