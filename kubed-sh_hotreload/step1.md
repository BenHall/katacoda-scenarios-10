Before we launch `kubed-sh`, let's get some examples set up:

`git clone https://github.com/mhausenblas/kubed-sh.git && cd kubed-sh/tc/node/`{{execute}}

Now let's first launch `kubed-sh` like so:

`kubed-sh`{{execute}}

Next, create a new terminal session (use the `+` sign, then select `Open New Terminal`) and launch `vi` to edit one of the scripts:

`vi test.js`{{execute}}

OK, so now we have `kubed-sh` and the Node.js script in an editor set up.
