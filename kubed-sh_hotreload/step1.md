Before we launch `kubed-sh`, let's get some examples set up:

`git clone https://github.com/mhausenblas/kubed-sh.git && cd kubed-sh/tc/node/`{{execute}}

Now create a new terminal session and launch `kubed-sh`{{execute}} there while in the first session you launch `vi` to edit one of the scripts:

`vi test.js`{{execute}}
