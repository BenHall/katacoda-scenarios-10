Before we launch `kubed-sh`, let's get some examples set up:

`git clone https://github.com/mhausenblas/kubed-sh.git`{{execute}}
`cd kubed-sh/tc/node/`{{execute}}

Now let's first launch `kubed-sh` like so:

`kubed-sh`{{execute}}

Now we create a second terminal session and launch `vi` in it to edit a script called `test.js`:

`cd kubed-sh/tc/node/`{{execute T2}}
`vi test.js`{{execute T2}}

OK, so now we have `kubed-sh` in one session and the Node.js script `test.js` in an another session, in the `vi` editor set up.
