Before we launch `kubed-sh`, let's get some examples set up:

`git clone https://github.com/mhausenblas/kubed-sh.git`{{execute}}
`cd kubed-sh/tc/node/`{{execute}}

Now let's first launch `kubed-sh` like so:

`kubed-sh`{{execute}}

Next, create a **new** terminal session using the `+` sign, (then selecting `Open New Terminal`) and launch `vi` in it to edit one of the scripts:

`cd kubed-sh/tc/node/`{{execute}}
`vi test.js`{{execute}}

OK, so now we have `kubed-sh` in one session and the Node.js script `test.js` in an another session, in the `vi` editor set up.
